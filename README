This is my code for plotting/analysing the results of UK political polls.

Currently contains only a handful of files I've tidied up:

(1) UK_polling_2005_to_present.xlsx 

-- an excel file with four sheets (2005-2010, 2010-2015, 2015-2017, 2017-2022)
   which contain all polling by BPC members as collated on the appropriate Wikipedia
   pages.

(2) poll_read.py

-- a python script for visualising how the polls have changed over the last decade +.

(3) example_output.png 

-- an example plot from poll_read.py

(4) Scots_independence_polls.xlsx

-- an excel file with one sheet, containing all the polls on the question "Should
   Scotland be an independent country?" from 2013-2017.

(5) scot_polls.py

-- a python script for visualising how support for Scottish Independence has varied
   over time.
