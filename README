This is some of my code for plotting/analysing the results of UK political polls.

(1) UK_polling_2005_to_present.xlsx 

-- an excel file with four sheets (2005-2010, 2010-2015, 2015-2017, 2017-2022)
   which contain all polling by BPC members as collated on the appropriate Wikipedia
   pages.

(2) poll_read.py

-- a python script for visualising how the polls have changed over the last decade +.

--------------------

(3) Scots_independence_polls.xlsx

-- an excel file with one sheet, containing all the polls on the question "Should
   Scotland be an independent country?" from 2013-2017.

(4) scot_polls.py

-- a python script for visualising how support for Scottish Independence has varied
   over time.

---------------------

(5) BES_2015_election_results.xlsx
(6) hanretty_EU_ref_figs.xlsx
(7) Westminster_Parliamentary_Constituencies_December_2016_Ultra_Generalised_Clipped_Boundaries_in_Great_Britain.geojson

-- files containing: the British Electoral Survey collated election & demographic data 
   for 2015, estimates for the EU referendum result in each constituency, and the 
   constituency boundaries and IDs in a .geojson file.

(8) election_map_script.py

-- script for making zoomable, colour-coded HTML maps of constituency based data, 
   currently written to produce such a map for the EU referendum result 
   (but this could easily be changed to plot e.g. demographic data.

(9) bokeh_example_map.py

-- script for making zoomable, colour-coded, *interactive* maps of constituency data,
   currently written to produce such a map for the EU referendum result.

(10) elections_ML.py

-- script for using scikit-learn methods on the BES dataset to predict electoral outcomes;
   currently uses Lasso regression to predict the EU referendum result in each constituency
   based on a variety of electoral and demographic data.
