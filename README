This is my code for plotting/analysing the results of UK political polls.

Currently contains only a handful of files I've tidied up:

(1) UK_polling_2005_to_present.xlsx 

-- an excel file with four sheets (2005-2010, 2010-2015, 2015-2017, 2017-2022)
   which contain all polling by BPC members as collated on the appropriate Wikipedia
   pages.

(2) poll_read.py

-- a python script for visualising how the polls have changed over the last decade +.

(3) example_output.png 

-- an example plot from poll_read.py

--------------------

(4) Scots_independence_polls.xlsx

-- an excel file with one sheet, containing all the polls on the question "Should
   Scotland be an independent country?" from 2013-2017.

(5) scot_polls.py

-- a python script for visualising how support for Scottish Independence has varied
   over time.

(7) hanretty_EU_ref_figs.xlsx
(8) Westminster_Parliamentary_Constituencies_December_2016_Ultra_Generalised_Clipped_Boundaries_in_Great_Britain.geojson

-- files containing: the British Electoral Survey collated election & demographic data for 2015, estimates for the
   EU referendum result in each constituency, and the constituency boundaries and IDs in a .geojson file.

(9) election_map_script.py

-- script for making .html zoomable, colour-coded maps of constituency based data, currently written to produce such
   a map for the EU referendum result (but this could easily be changed to plot e.g. demographic data.
